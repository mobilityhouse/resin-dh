Data generation
--------------
The data used by the Release Notes document is partially generated by
scripts.

The scripts are in ../scripts. bitbake-metadata2doc.sh is the main script.

bitbake-metadata2doc.sh relies on the existence of the following
directories:

* the BSP directory: the directory where fsl-community-bsp has been initialized
  (https://github.com/Freescale/fsl-community-bsp-platform) with `repo'
  The script uses BitBake so is suggested to have a previous build directory in
  this folder

* the gitdm directory: a clone of the
  https://github.com/OSSystems/gitdm repository (to generate
  statistics for the Acknowledgements section)

* the Documentation directory: this very repository. Note that
  bitbake-metadata2doc.sh assumes Documentation to be found in
  $BSPDIR/sources

To run bitbake-metadata2doc.sh, change to the scripts directory and run it
with the BSP directory, the gitdm repository directory, the initial
tag and the end tag (to gather commit statistics).

The script execution can take some time due to bitbake re-execution of
preliminary tasks.

Remember, EULA agreement will be shown in case it is not already accepted in
correspondent local.conf

Here's an example:

  $ cd ../scripts
  $ ./bitbake-metadata2doc.sh ~/src/fsl-community-bsp ~/src/gitdm 1.5 1.6

By default, bitbake-metadata2doc.sh collects data out of bitbake's
metadata for all machines it can find in the meta-fsl-arm and
meta-fsl-arm-extra layers.  You can restrict the machines to collect
data from by setting the MACHINES variable in your environment.

bitbake-metadata2doc.sh will write its output to release-note's `source'
directory.

To generate the formatted output for the release notes document, you
need to run "make <target>" from the release-notes directory.  It will
then use the data generated by bitbake-metadata2doc.sh.
